script react    --- creates the virtual dom - object that describes all the user interface components that you are going to have in your app

script react-dom -- converts the object from virtual dom and converts it to html components on your page


To create a React JS project is better to create it in the way that React intended.
npx create-react-app <<name>> 


npx                    to run (install)
create-react-app       is a node module
<<name>>

YOU CAN GO FAR USING ONLY "create-react-app"    --- professor Steve said

React JS App (right out of the box) - using npx create-react-app <<name>>
-package.json 
            dependencies
                  "react":          core script 
                  "react-dom":      core script
                  "react-scripts":  scripts for building the project 
                  "testing...."     
            scripts
                  "start":  "react-scripts start"      (our development server)
                  "build":  "react-scripts build"      (to create the production version)
                  "test":   "react-scripts test"       (to run Jest, to run tests on your script 
                  "eject":  "react-scripts eject"      (remove the app built in tools, to create own configuration)
-public folder 
            -index.html (it is a html template)  //container where webpack put all the React JS code, css...
-src folder
            -index.js (ReactDOM.render()   the file that converts the virtual dom to html)
            -App.js
---------------------------------------------------
By default yarn is used for building the create-react-app    
npm start  - to run the app on the server // to open the website 
npm test   - to run a test
