Components are function and they have a return statement

PROPS 
Props are properties that we can pass down from parent component to child component
Props is an object and contains all the variables from parent to child component 
example:

export default function App(){
   const name = 'Company Name';           //the App component has variables that passes as props 

   return (
      <div className="App">
         <Header company={name} />          A prop called company
      </div>
   );

}

---------------------------------
1. A component creates its own props to use them inside its FUNCTION COMPONENT 
    <Header company={name} />    creates a props.company 

2. function Header(props) {
      <h1>{props.company} </h1>
}
